Hey all,

Congratulations on completing web fundamentals! I have just unlocked the Python track for you all.

### (Please attempt this) 
I would like everyone to make an attempt at installing Python 2.7 on your computer. 

* If you use the **Windows** operating system, follow the directions outlined 
[here](http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/7/4688/24617). Note that there are known issues regarding Python in Git Bash, look [here](http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/7/4689/31243) for how to fix those.
 
* If you use the **Mac/OSX** operating system I would like you to download the package from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/python-2.7.14-macosx10.6.pkg), and install it on your computer. I **do not** recommend the installation described on the platform for Mac/OSX.
<br><br>Also please install or attempt to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Go into your terminal and run:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" 
```
 
* If you use a **GNU/Linux** operating system you may already have Python 2.7 installed.

**Q.** How to check that Python 2.7 is installed?

**A.** Open your terminal/command line and type the following: 
```
python --version
```
It will tell you the version of python you have installed, anything from 2.7.10 or newer should be fine.

<hr>

**Q.** How do I know if [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) (Python's package manager) is installed?

**A.** Open your terminal/command line and type the following: 
```
pip -V
```
It will tell you the version of pip you have installed, the current version is 9.0.1

### (Please do this) 
Next, I would like for you to read up to ["Loops"](http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/7/4689/24633) in the Python Fundamentals section before class on Monday.

### (Mandatory) 
Lastly, I want you all to have a relaxing weekend and I look forward to seeing you all in class on Monday. 


Will
